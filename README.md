## PYTHONPATH

If you are on Linux:

  - Open your favorite terminal program;
  
  - Open the file `~/.bashrc` in your text editor â€“ e.g. `gedit ~/.bashrc`
  
  - Add the following line to the end:
    
    `export PYTHONPATH=/home/my_user/code`
  
  - Save the file.
  
  - Close your terminal application;
  
  - Start your terminal application again, to read in the new settings, and type this:

    `echo $PYTHONPATH`
    
  - It should show something like `/home/my_user/code`
